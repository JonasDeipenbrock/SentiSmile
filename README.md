## Idea

Press the microphone in the page center and say a sentence (You may need to allow microphone access). The page then analyses that sentence and shows you the sentiment.

## Implementation

The page uses the webkit api to get the text from the spoken input and sends it to googles language api to get the sentiment. It then shows the analysis.
